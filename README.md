# Twitter Sentiment Analysis  

This repository contains a complete pipeline for performing sentiment analysis on tweets, leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool for understanding public opinion, market trends, and user sentiment, particularly when applied to Twitter, a platform that reflects real-time thoughts and events.

## Key Features
- **Tweet Preprocessing**:  
  Includes removing noise like special characters, URLs, hashtags, and user mentions while also handling tokenization and case normalization.
  
- **Dataset**:  
  Utilizes a dataset of tweets annotated with sentiment labels, such as "Positive," "Negative," and "Neutral." These labels are used for supervised machine learning.

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  Converts textual data into numerical representations using techniques like:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - Word Embeddings (optional)

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  Implements various classification algorithms for sentiment prediction, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Deep Learning models (if applicable)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Measures the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

- **Visualization**:  
  Offers data visualization tools for understanding sentiment trends, including bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds for most frequent positive/negative words.

- **Deployment**:  
  The final model can be deployed using a web application framework like Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to input custom tweets and receive real-time sentiment analysis.
